Differences in Romantic Relationship Experiences for Individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder
Grace Hancock1 · Mark A. Stokes1 · Gary Mesibov2

ASD: Persistent dificts in social communication and interaction; restricted or repititive patterns of behaviour, interests or activities.
These cause clinically significant impairment in numerous areas of functioning
(education, employment) -> more social opputunity eg. in college or workplace
learn less about romantic functioning from peers because of spending less time with them(social withdrawal)
difficulty communicating emotions, misunderstanding of actions or perception 
this study confirms the affect of positive peer engagement

Attitude and risk of substance use in adolescents diagnosed with Asperger syndrome
M. Ramosa,∗, L. Boadaa, C. Morenoa,b, C. Llorentea,b, J. Romoa, M. Parelladaa,b

diminished risk(identified in two different studies), negative attitude towards drugs which seems to fit with the norm-abiding, party-avoiding lifestyle
they hypothesized both lower risk of abuse and personality traits would be associated with less risk of substance abuse.
Study Design: AS vs healthy participants

Auditory Deficits in Audiovisual
Speech Perception in Adult
Asperger’s Syndrome: fMRI Study
Fabian-Alexander Tietze1, Laura Hundertmark1, Mandy Roy1,2, Michael Zerr3,Christopher Sinke1, Daniel Wiswede4,5, Martin Walter6, Thomas F. Münte4,5 andGregor R. Szycik1*

AudioVisual integration deficits been proposed to underlie difficulties in speech percep=tion
children: Speech perception deficits seem to be amplified in acoustically noisy environments.
AV deficits in speech perception dissappear in early adolescence(Foxe 2015)
BA 41, BA42 (cortical level?) Less activity for unisensory input for AS (aspergers syndrome)
Limitation of this exp: no multisensory

The Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence II: What about Asperger Syndrome?
Isabelle Soulieres, Michelle Dawson, Morton Ann Gernsbacher, Laurent Mottron

32 aspreger adults 25 children; 39-27 non-
Distinctive uneven profile of intelligence
Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM)
Individuals on spectrum curretnly identified accd to overt atypicalities in socio-communicative behaviours, focussed interests and repititive behaviours
More fundamientally, atypical info processing accross domains(social, non-social) and modalities(auditory,visual) raising the question of how best toaccess these individual' abilities
Wechsler scales and RPM to measure IQ
RPM: minimizes spoken instruction and obviates speech production or typicality of exps; finding missing geometric piece type Qs
-----------------old studies on autism (not aspergers)avg 30%ile higher on RPM than on Wescccc....
Adults:
Average RPM: 74th %ile, Weschler FSIQ 47th percentile
that was significantly greater than non-aspie
for aspie: VIQ>PIQ 55 vs 39 %ile

Work and Spirituality: An exploratory study
Ines Testoni, Sofia Pesci, Ciro De Vincenzo, Laura Dal Corso & Adriano Zamperini

2019 Asperger Syndrome 
12 people 6M 6F
from other study: death anxiety at the core of a range of severe mental disorders
					Positive outcome would be open-mindedness
poeple beleive in faith because immortality reduces death anxiety to reinforce their existence resilience
** refs to a lot of other popular ASD and AS studies, excellent refs related to work, faith
	eg: workers: great precision and concentration
Prefer working alone resulting from relational difficulties with others that mine their self-esteem
Aspie-friedly workplace how?: Training progs aimed at colleagues to explain meaning of AS and advice on how to behave, what to expect
for AS people, that would provide a sense of community

Stalking, and Social and Romantic Functioning Among Adolescents and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder
Mark Stokes Æ Naomi Newton Æ Archana Kaur
2007 study

Interesting Abstract --read
Parental reports of 25 ASd, 38 typical 
From other studies: social impairment, move into adulthood with inadequate social competence; Considerable Anecdotal Evidence exists illustrating ASDs engaging in stalking behaviour when seeking contact for friendship or intimacy.
One of the hypothesis is that they will engage in socially unacceptable behaviour. and won't take No/disinterest for an answer.
Strong desire could lead to illegal behaviour. 
** Too many assumptions; Survey questions framed in accoradance to these assumptions.

Atypical Movement Performance and Sensory Integration in Asperger’s Syndrome
Panagiotis Siaperas • Howard A. Ring •Catherine J. McAllister • Sheila Henderson •Anna Barnett • Peter Watson • Anthony J. Holland

Investigate whether AS have impaired motor abilities and sensorimotor processing and if these are age related.

AS largely considered in terms of dysfunction in the social domain. However, abnormal motor perf observed going as far back as Hans Asperger's early descriptions.
** this paper links to a lot of other good studies: eg the one with swedish school kids 
Other studies: described as clumsy, dypraxic, bad ball skills, awkward stance and walk, playground and handwritng impaired skills
Compelling evidence suggests atypical sensorimotor system.
Ayres 1989 study: difficulty in planning and carrying out skilled motor acts in correct sequence. Disrupted sensory integration leading to motor function probs.

50 AS Children, 50 non
AS have significant impairments(in most people) across the sensorimotor funcs investigated and they persist into later childhood. Some cases that did not display, had specific skills and interests that they practices(eg skateboard, guitar).
Motivation and Practice could help improve.
Impairments in movement performance and sensorimotor
processing cause anxiety and confusion when individuals
with AS have to participate in novel activities. This
could be an additional factor contributing to the manifestation
of behavioural problems and the tendency to develop
fixed routines of activities (Smith-Roley et al. 2001)
Add to that, poor self-esteem :(
This test: Anxiety and impulsivity could have affected performance. 
** They suspect that it persists to adulthood but no proof.

I have NOT RESEARCHed YET: BLOG POST
https://life-with-aspergers.blogspot.com/2008/04/what-does-low-muscle-tone-hyptonia-mean.html
Low Muscle Hypotonia
Tasks that require muscle strength and balance: BAD
In running, gives unusual gait, affects writing, speech, pencil grip
Slump: when stading and sitting for long periods; this looks uncomfortable to others but is comfortable to aspies
Aspies often sit with their head and shoulders rolled forward and will frequesntly lean on things
Slower and get tired easily when playing and running (not good for team sports)
Fix isn't normal weight training but physiotherapy and constant awareness
